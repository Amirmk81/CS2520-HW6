# CS2520-HW6
Our group, consisting of Matthew Cheser, Amir Kouhpainejad, and Kevin Kongwattanachai collaborated on a project to refactor an existing codebase. After forking the original project, we worked together to make the code more flexible and adaptable to various requirements and preferences. We made the code easier to read and maintainable by changing it to a modular format. We added comments, functions, and organized the code to make it more clear, concise, and reusable. Using Git for version control, we were able to collaborate effectively, track all the changes, and resolve conflicts during development. Each new version included messages to document changes, and the final project was published on a GitHub page where all changes and modifications are viewable.
